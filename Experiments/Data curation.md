-  Collect real news articles of recent events **R**
	- Choose a minimum event date - so it has to have happened AFTER a certain date, so that the language models were not trained on this dataset
- Collect human-authored fake news **H**
- Pair R and H
	- f.e. for each news event R, there should be N distorted news $$
H_{0}, \dots, H_{n}
