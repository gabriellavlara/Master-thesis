1. For each model in M, average results. Find out which one produces synthetic fakes that retrieve more human fakes

2. For each prompting strategy in P, average results. Check which prompting style generates fakes that align most with real ones 

3. Test other parameters, such as temperature (how random an LLM samples when choosing next token)
