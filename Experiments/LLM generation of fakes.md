1. For each news-event collected in **R**, generate different misinformation **S** posts $$
S_{i} = \{s_{i,m,p}|m \in M, p \in P\}
$$according to the following parameters: 
- *Large Language Model m*: $$
M = \{LlaMa, GPT3, {Depsek}\}
$$
- *Prompting technique p:* $$
 P = \{strategy_{1}, strategy_{2}, strategy_{3}\}
$$
Strategies could be f.e. fake news categories in [[MegaFake - A Theory-Driven Dataset of Fake News Generated by LargeLanguage Models]]; or, if focus on propaganda, then left and right oriented posts. 

The prompt should contain title and summary of news event, but shouldn't be whole news article, to have more creative variants of the news and not just paraphrasing. 

Control parameters are (t.b.d):
- Post length (not more than what fits in a Tweet)
- 
#### **Goal**: generate pairs $$
(r_{i}, S_{i})
$$ containing a real-world and different false versions of this event.
