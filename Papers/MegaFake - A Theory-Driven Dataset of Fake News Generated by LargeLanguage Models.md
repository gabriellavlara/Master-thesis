- Main idea: generated fake news dataset **MegaFake** built on top of GossipCop dataset
    - Motivation: build benchmark to train/test detectors
- Detecting fake news: content- (analyse linguistic elements, such as syntax and semantics) vs. context based (propagation patterns of news articles) approach
- Categories of LLM-generated info:
    - Style based fake → Sheep´s clothing: rewrite an article with a sensational tone OR rewrite fake news article with objective and neutral style
    - Content based fake → manipulate by modifying multiple attributes
    - Integration based fake → information blending: integrate fake and legitimate news for creating new fake content
    - Story based fake → Narrative generation: generate fake from a certain message (given a title, create a false news)
    - Style based legitimate (polish legitimate news)
    - Integration based legitimate (synthetize two articles into one)
